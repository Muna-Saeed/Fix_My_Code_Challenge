# Fix My Code Challenge

This repository contains several code challenges that require fixing existing code. The goal is to identify and correct the issues in each code file. Below are the details of each task and the corresponding file that has been fixed.

## Task 0: FizzBuzz

File fixed: `0x00-challenge/0-fizzbuzz.py`

The FizzBuzz code in Python has been fixed. It now correctly replaces multiples of 3 with "Fizz," multiples of 5 with "Buzz," and multiples of both 3 and 5 with "FizzBuzz."

## Task 1: Print Square

File fixed: `0x00-challenge/1-print_square.js`

The code for printing a square in JavaScript has been fixed. It now correctly prints a square of "#" characters with the given size.

## Task 2: Sort

File fixed: `0x00-challenge/2-sort.rb`

The code for sorting arguments in Ruby has been fixed. It now correctly handles non-numeric arguments and produces the expected output of sorting and printing them in ascending order.

## Task 3: User Password

File fixed: `0x00-challenge/3-user.py`

The User class code in Python has been fixed. The `is_valid_password` method now correctly returns `True` if the provided password matches the user's password.

## Task 4: Double Linked List

Files fixed: `0x00-challenge/4-delete_dnodeint/main.c`, `0x00-challenge/4-delete_dnodeint/free_dlistint.c`, `0x00-challenge/4-delete_dnodeint/print_dlistint.c`, `0x00-challenge/4-delete_dnodeint/add_dnodeint_end.c`, `0x00-challenge/4-delete_dnodeint/delete_dnodeint_at_index.c`

The code for the Double Linked List in C has been fixed. It now correctly adds and deletes nodes, creating a double linked list and performing operations at specific indices.

You can find the fixed code in the [Fix_My_Code_Challenge](https://github.com/Muna-Saeed/Fix_My_Code_Challenge) repository under the `0x00-challenge` directory.
